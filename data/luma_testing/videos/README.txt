This folder contains the dataset used in the paper "Seeing Red: PPG Biometrics Using Smartphone Cameras", 
published in the 15th IEEE Computer Vision Society Workshop on Biometrics (https://www.vislab.ucr.edu/Biometrics2020/).

This folder 'videos' contains the videos used for the paper.
These are .mp4 videos taken with an iPhone X camera while the participant placed his index finger on top of the
camera.

Out of 15 participants, only 14 gave permission to share their data and are therefore present here.
Each video contains one session, i.e., the participant sits and provides a 30 seconds long measurement.
For a video anonymized_videos/<USR>/<TIMESTAMP>.mp4 the <USR> folder identifies the participant, the 
<TIMESTAMP> is the relative timestamp in seconds from the time the first measurement was taken (across the
whole dataset).
